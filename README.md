# ChatGPT Mobile (React Native/Expo)

A personal project that mimics ChatGPT in a RN mobile app. This utilizes the [Node.js client for the unofficial ChatGPT API](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api), and [OpenAI API Quickstart](https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-node). 

I made this project to not only expand my knowledge and skills in creating beatiful and functional mobile applications, but to also explore the world of AI and its impact on the technological world.

## Here are some cool features!

### Multi-conversations

Just like the web client, this project mimics this feature by allowing you to have multiple conversations with ChatGPT.

### Regenerate Response

Regnerate responses to get the answer you desire. 

### Retain previous conversation

Have a conversation with ChatGPT!

### Edit inputs

It will even retain previous information!

### Error/Network handling

Provide an error warning and the ability to regnererate your response.

## Beautiful UI 

This app was built with attention to detail and elgegant UI. Hope you like it!
